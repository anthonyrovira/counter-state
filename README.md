## About The Project
This project has been developped using ReactJS. This is a very simple architecture made for learning purposes.
### State Management
So far, three state managers are implemented in the same project:
- Redux
- Zustand
- useContext (+ useReducer)

### Other informations
- Each counter goes from 0 to 10.
- To help understand, open the Console section of the browser inspector and get into the 3 children components to see how it works.
